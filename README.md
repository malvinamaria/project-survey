# Survey form with React

The focus of this week's project was to leverage the full capabilities of React by incorporating State. The objective was to develop a survey similar to Typeform for gathering information from users.

## The problem
To begin with, I created a rough draft of the survey questions. During the project, I gained experience in various types of input and learned how to connect them to the React hook, useState. The inputs I included were text input, checkbox, a dropdown menu, radio buttons, and textarea. If given more time, I would incorporate additional elements and allow the inputs to be utilized instead of having a "Next" button.
